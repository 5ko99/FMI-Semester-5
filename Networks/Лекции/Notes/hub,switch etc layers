Повторителите работят на физическо ниво.

Хъб на физическо ниво.

Суичовете работят на канално (второ) ниво. In other words, switch divides collision domain of hosts, but broadcast domain remains same.

 A bridge operates at data link layer.

 Router is mainly a Network Layer device.

 Collisions are often in a hub environment, because each port on a hub is in the same collision domain. By contrast, each port on a bridge, a switch or a router is in a separate collision domain.



 All ports on a hub or a switch are by default in the same broadcast domain. All ports on a router are in the different broadcast domains and routers don’t forward broadcasts from one broadcast domain to another.
