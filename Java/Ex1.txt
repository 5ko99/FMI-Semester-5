long l = 1L; - for creating long
float f = 0.1; - will not compile because 0.1 by default it's long
float f = 0.1F;

0x-hexadecimal
0b- binary
0 - octa

for readability
int million = 1_000_000;

Data types convert
"1234" + 99 = "123499"
(data_type) var; - for casting

Wrapper types
int - Integer - Class of int. Can be accessed as a class.

Character c = 'a' // Autoboxing

Strings
They are immutable
When you create String with new the String goes in to heap. With .intern() you move a string from heap to string pool(reference pool)
Comparing Strings. with == you compare the reference of the strings. To compare content you need to use equals()
Operations:
    Concat with +

In Java 15 you can use multi-line string
String a = """
                accessed
                accessed
                equals"""
charAt(i) - no [i] like C/C++
split("(separator)") - gives String[]

New Switch Case Syntaxes 
switch(a){
    case "a" -> ...
    case "b" -> ...
    default -> ...
}//Without need of using break
Also switch can return value and to use it for init
